## 2026-03-05 - SymPy Lie Derivative Bottleneck
**Learning:** Repeated applications of `sympy.simplify()` during sequential differentiation (like computing Lie derivatives) causes exponential expression tree bloat, slowing down computation from seconds to minutes as dimensionality increases (e.g., from 0.86s to 158s for 8 vars).
**Action:** Use `sympy.expand()` to pre-check expressions for zero and to simplify intermediate derivatives before taking the next derivative. Only fallback to `sympy.simplify()` if `expand()` does not yield zero but a zero-check is necessary.

## 2025-03-05 - Subspace Operations SVD Bottleneck
**Learning:** Geometric control algorithms heavily rely on SVD for rank and basis computations (`np.linalg.svd`). By default, NumPy computes full `M x M` and `N x N` unitary matrices (`U` and `V`), which is extremely slow when concatenating tall/wide matrices for subspace sums and intersections.
**Action:** Always use `compute_uv=False` when only singular values are needed (e.g., `rank`), and `full_matrices=False` when computing bases for rectangular matrices to compute the drastically faster "economy-size" SVD.

## 2026-03-05 - Sparse Vector Field Differentiation Bottleneck
**Learning:** Control systems often involve sparse vector fields (e.g., `g = [0, 0, 1]`). Computing Lie derivatives `(grad h) . v` unconditionally differentiates the function `h` with respect to all variables, even when the corresponding vector component is exactly 0. This results in an enormous amount of wasted symbolic computation.
**Action:** When computing sums of symbolic derivatives multiplied by vector components, always check `if v != 0:` to skip the expensive `sympy.diff` computation for zero components. This yields a massive (~150x) speedup for sparse vectors.
